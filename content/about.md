I am Vaibhav Kaushik, a third-year student in JIIT, Noida.  
I am interested in system administration, distributed systems and Linux. I like programming in Go, C++, C and Python.  

This blog is used not only to catalogue projects that I worked on but also to serve as a journal for my more long-form thoughts on FLOSS culture.
